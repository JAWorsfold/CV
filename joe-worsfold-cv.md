### **Education**

#### Birkbeck, University of London | MSc Computer Science | Distinction | 09/2017 - 09/2019

Developed a deep understanding of core computer science principles, with a particular emphasis on algorithms, data structures, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP). The program honed my ability to build scalable, efficient software solutions, particularly for my interest area of big data and AI-driven applications.

##### Thesis: Character-level Convolutional Neural Networks for Hate Speech Detection with Intelligent Adversaries

Trained a CNN-based text classifier to automatically categorize large volumes of textual data. The project involved preprocessing raw text data, including tokenization and vectorization, and training multiple CNN models for multi-class classification. The model was designed to recognize subtle differences in language patterns, enabling high accuracy in distinguishing between various categories of text. This thesis combined my knowledge of NLP, deep learning, and data processing, culminating in a successful demonstration of text classification at scale.
