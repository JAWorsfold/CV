## Recent Achievements
### Hack Hate 2020: Hate Detector
#### 10/2020

üèÜ Winner: Best use of AI / ML (awarded by AWS)  
üèÜ Winner: Best use of location (awarded by ESRI)

**Presentation**: https://youtu.be/xDyxznaKjCQ?t=1913 | **Code**: https://github.com/HateDetector

Utilising my in-depth knowledge of `Python` and Master's thesis research, I spearheaded a team of engineers to develop a tool to detect and visualise networks of hate speech. The team scraped 18.5 million tweets related to the 2020 US Election and classified them using a consensus of three machine learning models: `Logistic Regression`, `Support Vector Machines`, and `Convolutional Neural Networks`. The data was loaded into a `Neo4j` graph database and visualised in order to analyse trends and see patterns in the data.

- Working closely with designers and user researchers to implement wireframes and ensure the best possible user experience.
- Writing clear and concise release notes for updates to the product and collaborating with the DevOps team to ensure the release notes are timed correctly alongside our pipeline for deployment.

##### Back-end Development
- Implementing and maintaining a REST API in `Node.js` with back-end connections to NoSQL databases including `MongoDB`.
- Working with multiple applications and application logic in `Docker` containers and managing them with `Kubernetes`, as well as experience using `Drone` for Continuous Integration.
- Adding the infrastructure for new data sources to be loaded to the product, including work on the API, data stories, and creating mock data for testing.
- Creating bespoke scripts to improve the efficiency and robustness of the product, for example, a `Python` script to update specified `Kubernetes` secrets when new data sources are added.

##### Data Science and Analysis
- Advising and collaborating with Data Scientists when working on a `Python` packages that contain reusable code across repositories. For example, a `Neo4j` wrapper class to make connecting and reading data more abstract and user friendly.
- Working closely with the Product Manager to capture useful usage statistics on the product, for example, by re-writing MongoDB queries and utilising JavaScript to do complex queries to gain further insight.
