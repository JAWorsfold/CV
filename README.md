## Recent Achievements
### Hack Hate 2020: Hate Detector
#### 10/2020

üèÜ Winner: Best use of AI / ML (awarded by AWS)  
üèÜ Winner: Best use of location (awarded by ESRI)

**Presentation**: https://youtu.be/xDyxznaKjCQ?t=1913 | **Code**: https://github.com/HateDetector

Utilising my in-depth knowledge of `Python` and Master's thesis research, I spearheaded a team of engineers to develop a tool to detect and visualise networks of hate speech. The team scraped 18.5 million tweets related to the 2020 US Election and classified them using a consensus of three machine learning models: `Logistic Regression`, `Support Vector Machines`, and my own `Convolutional Neural Network`. The data was loaded into a `Neo4j` graph database and visualised in order to analyse trends and see patterns in the data.

## Experience

### Lead Software Engineer (Tech Lead) | Flock Cover | London
#### 02/2023 - present

- **Developing the Next-Generation Insurance Platform**: I am responsible for working across the full stack to design, build, and deploy new features using cutting-edge serverless technologies in AWS. This includes developing with tools like NodeJS, TypeScript, Postgres, and Scala.
- **Quality Assurance and Code Review**: I ensure the delivery of high-quality, well-tested features into our production system on a regular basis. I also review the code of my fellow developers via Pull Requests on GitHub to maintain our high standards.
- **Mentorship and Pair Programming**: I work directly with other developers through pair programming and provide mentorship to less experienced team members, fostering a culture of knowledge sharing and continuous improvement within our team.
- **Participation in Agile Practices**: I actively participate in Agile ceremonies such as planning sessions, retrospectives, stand-ups, etc. I collaborate with the Product and Tech team to design and estimate new features, and I help maintain and improve our infrastructure and pipelines.
- **Research and Continuous Learning**: I proactively research new technologies to help us maintain a competitive edge. I am committed to learning new tech stacks when required, and I focus on developing a deep understanding of AWS serverless technologies to effectively deploy and monitor our platform.
