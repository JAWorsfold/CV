Problem
To understand the networks and patterns of hate and how such content is spread.

The dissemination of hate speech online and across social media continues to be a significant issue for which there is no quick-fix. Despite attempts by platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, and increasing pressure from Governments to solve the problem, there is yet to be a consistent way to stop the spread of hate. As it is inappropriate to stop the posts being created, and platforms take time to deal with reports, it is useful to understand the networks and patterns of hate and how such content is spread.

Solution
Utilising state-of-the-art machine learning models, our project is able to scrape social media platforms and classify comments as either hate speech or not hate. The scraping is designed to focus on a specific real-world event - the US election as an example - and once classified the comments and their links are examinable and visualised as a graph. In doing so it is possible to build a case against prolific contributors of hate speech and/ or understand how it is spread across platforms and communities online.

## Education
### Birkbeck, University of London | MSc Computer Science | Distinction
#### 09/2017 - 09/2019
This intensive programme provided a solid grounding for a career in IT, imparting an in-depth knowledge of computing, software development, and programming. I investigated current areas of research from `Cloud Computing` and `Big Data`, to `Machine Learning` and `Natural Language Processing`.

In addition to cutting-edge research, the course covered a variety of topics including `Object-Oriented` and `Functional Programming`, SOLID principles and Design Patterns, the `Software Development Life Cycle`, `Information Systems and Retrieval`, `Computer Architecture`, `Operating Systems`, and fundamentals from `binary` and `boolean algebra`, to `data structures and algorithms`.

#### Projects
##### Character-Level CNN for Hate Speech Detection with Intelligent Adversaries
For my Masters thesis I trained a selection of Machine Learning models (`Linear Regression`, `Support Vector Machines`, `Na√Øve Bayes`) to detect hate speech, taking into account the presence of intelligent adversaries. The final implementation made use of a `Convolutional Neural Network` trained on both existing data sets and data which I extracted via the Twitter API. I was able to significantly improve upon existing benchmarks for the classification of hate speech that has been intentionally obfuscated. For the code and thesis report, I was awarded a Distinction.

##### Simple Machine Language (SML)
Following a `TDD` approach, I was tasked with developing an Interpreter in Java for a predefined SML. The Interpreter had to translate a set of simple instructions, execute the instructions and print the final value of any used registers. Practising SOLID principles, I used: `Reflection`, `Dependency Injection`, and `Design Patterns` ‚Äì Factory and Singleton in this case ‚Äì to implement the final Interpreter.

##### Philip Hammond and the Temple of Gloom
Having been provided with an extensive Java program I had to interpret the existing code base and extend it with a program capable of completing a given simulation. The simulation consisted of an explorer, Philip, finding an Orb in a maze, followed by escaping with as much treasure as possible. Utilising common algorithms like `Dijkstra‚Äôs Shortest Path`, I achieved a respectable score and in doing so learnt to work with Java `concurrency` and a Java `GUI` application.
