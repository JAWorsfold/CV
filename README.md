## Recent Achievements
### Hack Hate 2020: Hate Detector
#### 10/2020

üèÜ Winner: Best use of AI / ML (awarded by AWS)  
üèÜ Winner: Best use of location (awarded by ESRI)

**Presentation**: https://youtu.be/xDyxznaKjCQ?t=1913 | **Code**: https://github.com/HateDetector

Utilising my in-depth knowledge of `Python` and master's thesis research, I spearheaded a team of developers and researchers to engineer a tool to detect and visualise networks of hate speech, in relation to real-world events. As the team lead I contributed the majority of the code for both the social media `scraping` and hate speech `text classification` using `machine learning` models. In total I scraped 18.5 million tweets - related to the 2020 US Election - and classified them as either hate or non-hate. To make the classification I used a consensus of three models trained using the following techniques/ algorithms: `Logistic Regression`, `Support Vector Machines`, and `Convolutional Neural Networks`.

To explore and analyse the data I constructed a graph data model - CLUE: Comment, Link, User, Event - that we'd follow when loading that data into `Neo4j` (a common graph database). Having loaded the content into this model it was possible to explore trends within the data. Using `Ne4j Bloom` it was also possible to visualise these trends and analyse them in an interactive way. For example, it was possible to visually map hate content to common hashtags and shared websites. Additionally, as a team we analysed the amount of hate content created over time and across US states (where location data was available).

#### 10/2020 - present

___
### Software Engineer | UK Home Office | Croydon/ London
#### 09/2020 - 10/2020

##### Front-end Development
- Developing and maintaining internal web applications in `AngularJS` and `ReactJS` with a focus on `TDD` and `BDD`. Currently in the process of migrating code from AngularJS to ReactJs.
- Working closely with designers and user researchers to implement wireframes, meet user needs, and ensure the best possible User Experience and User Interface.
- Writing clear and concise release notes for updates to the product and collaborating with the DevOps team to ensure the release notes are timed correctly alongside our pipeline and deployment time frame.

##### Back-end Development
- Implementing and maintaining a REST API in `Node.js` with back-end connections to NoSQL databases including `MongoDB`.
- Working with multiple applications and application logic in `Docker` containers and managing them with `Kubernetes`, as well as experience using `Drone` for Continuous Integration.
- Adding the infrastructure for new data sources to be loaded to the product, including work on the API, data stories, and creating mock data for testing.
- Creating bespoke scripts to improve the efficiency and robustness of the product, for example, a `Python` script to update specified `Kubernetes` secrets when new data sources are added.

##### Data Science and Analysis
- Advising and collaborating with Data Scientists on their code, for example, working on a `Python` package to contain any commonly used code across repositories. For example, a `Neo4j` wrapper class to make connecting and reading data more abstract and user friendly.
- Working closely with the Product Manager to capture useful usage statistics on the product. For example, by re-writing MongoDB queries and utilising JavaScript to do complex queries to gain further insight and present data more effectively.

### IT Developer | Mott MacDonald | Croydon
#### 09/2018 - 09/2020

##### Corporate Applications Development:
- Designed and developed a program (`Java 8`, `TDD`, `Maven`) to integrate data from our Legacy Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) to our new Cloud Based ERP system. Applying `SOLID principles` the program made use of `Dependency Injection` and common `Design Patterns` including Factory, Consumer, and Producer patterns. In the process, creating a bespoke RESTful API library for making requests to the new ERP.
- Analysed and developed a prototype procurement and purchasing integration between ServiceNow and our ERP. Written in `JavaScript`, the integration utilised RESTful APIs, complex workflows, business rules and SMTP servers.
- Cloud based back-end development of extensions - in `Java` with `XML` configurations - to our ERP (PaaS). Acting as the lead technical expert on extensions, despite only being with the company for a short time. Highlighting my ability to grasp new technologies.
- Designing, developing, and deploying bespoke integrations with our ERP. Utilising Java (8 and above) and recent improvements in `Object Oriented` and `Functional` Programming such as: `Streams`, `Lambdas`, and `Monads`.
- Developing electronic forms in JavaScript, Java, and `PL/SQL` with a focus on UI and UX.

##### Software Development Life Cycle:
- Led the first in-house release of a new extended version of our ERP system. Conducted the merging, deployment and testing (integration, system, helped with regression) of the new code base in our Staging and UAT environments.
- Participated in `Agile` development, mainly `Scrum` with elements of `Kanban`, frequently deputising for the Scrum master during Stand-ups and Sprint Retrospectives.
- Worked closely with our Operations team to support the business in the day-to-day use of our systems. Often taking calls directly with users to gather user stories and provide technical advice.
- Analysed Product Backlog items in order to effectively estimate ‚Äì via `planning poker` ‚Äì the effort/ time to develop. In addition to undertaking technical feasibility analysis of more complex items.
- Engaged in all forms of testing including `unit testing`, `integration testing`, `system testing`, `regression testing`, `user acceptance testing` and `smoke testing`, as well as regularly `peer reviewing` the work of other developers.
