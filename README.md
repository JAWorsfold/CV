## Achievements
### Hack Hate 2020: Hate Detector
#### 10/2020

üèÜ Winner: Best use of AI / ML (awarded by AWS)  
üèÜ Winner: Best use of location (awarded by ESRI)

**Presentation**: https://youtu.be/xDyxznaKjCQ?t=1913 | **Code**: https://github.com/HateDetector

Utilising my in-depth knowledge of `Python` and Master's thesis research, I spearheaded a team of engineers to develop a tool to detect and visualise networks of hate speech. The team scraped 18.5 million tweets related to the 2020 US Election and classified them using a consensus of three machine learning models: `Logistic Regression`, `Support Vector Machines`, and my own `Convolutional Neural Network`. The data was loaded into a `Neo4j` graph database and visualised in order to analyse trends and see patterns in the data.
